Here is a record of the sql code I used:

-- Combining all 12 tables into 1 for easy querying for the whole year
truncate table bb_data_2024
insert into bb_data_2024 (
	ride_id,
	rideable_type, 
	started_at,
	ended_at, 
	start_station_name, 
	start_station_id, 
	end_station_name, 
	end_station_id, 
	start_lat, 
	start_lng, 
	end_lat, 
	end_lng, 
	member_casual 
)
