# bluebikeproject
Welcome to my first data analytics project

The goal of this porject is to creating a dashboard to analyze 2024 Bluebike data. I am using Boston Transportation Department's 2020 visualizion as inspriration:https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0f5fc6ed107d4c0491d24051eed77ff9 

I am looking to answer the following questions:
- What is the most frequent Bluebike trip? Why?
- Where should a new blue bike station go?
- What are the most popular start and end stations in 2024, and how do they change by season?
- What percentage of users are members?
- What is the average trip duration by month, and how does it trend across the year?

I will be using Bluebike data from their official website: https://bluebikes.com/system-data 


Data includes:
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- Stop Time and Date
- Start Station Name & ID
- End Station Name & ID
- Bike ID
- User Type (Casual = Single Trip or Day Pass user; Member = Annual or Monthly Member)


Next steps: Integrate live data for 2025 and build an auto-refresh dashboard
